# portfolioreact2
My name is Dustin Micklos and this is my personal portfolio webpage built with React technology and Tailwind CSS styling. 
The portfolio page provides personal information about myself and prior professional experiences, as well as detailed listings of recent projects and contact information.  
The project section, highlighting four recent projects, contains interactive links that will direct the user to the homepage of each project.
The Contact Me section provides my phone number, email address, and links to my LinkedIn profile and Github profile.
